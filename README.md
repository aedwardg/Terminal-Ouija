## About

Terminal Ouija is a terminal-based "choose your own adventure" with a dark twist.
You (the player) find yourself at an odd antiquities shop, where the proprietor offers to show you his most-treasured relic.  
Before you know it, you are trapped in a terrifying s√©ance, surrounded by some of the most deadly horror movie villains of all time.

Ages 10+

### Technology

This game was made entirely with the magic of [Node.js]('https://nodejs.org/en/')
